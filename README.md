** TODO LIST USING MERN STACK **
    
    In this project I create a ToDo App using MERN stack. 

    Where any user can create their own account(signup/login) with all CRUD(create, read, update, delete) 
    
    functionality and after logging in user can also edited his/her profile and manage their todos/tasks sepratedly. 
    
    This app has RESTful APIs that allows developers to create, read, update, and delete to-do lists and items.
    
    Users can create multiple to-do items, each with a name and a checkbox indicating whether the task is complete or not.

    In this App I use database as MongoDB to store user's informations and todos and todo-list as well.
